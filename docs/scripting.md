# LegacyScript
Create a `.ls` asset, save it, and attach it to a GameObject. Multiple independently
enabled scripts run in isolated Lua states with `self` bound to their owner.
Existing `.lua` assets remain supported. Lifecycle callbacks are `onStart`,
`onUpdate(deltaTime)`, `onFixedUpdate(deltaTime)` and `onDestroy`.

```lua
@export target GameObject
@export speed number 5

function onStart()
    debug.log("Started", self:getName())
end

function onUpdate(dt)
    if target and isButtonDown("Move") then
        target:translate(speed * dt, 0, 0)
    end
end
```

Define `Move` in Project → Input Settings first. Exported fields appear in the
script's Inspector. Drag objects/components/assets into reference slots; **X**
clears them. Supported values include number, boolean, string, GameObject, engine
component types, Asset and AudioClip. Defaults are literals, not Lua expressions.
Declarations must lead a line; `---@export` comments remain compatible. Bare
`@export` is preprocessed before Lua runs, preserving error line numbers.
Exports currently become globals in the attachment's state: do not shadow them
with local declarations. Missing references bind as `nil` at script startup.

The Lua Editor's Execute action resolves the open asset's selected owner, or its
unique owner automatically. Shared assets require selecting an owner. Open assets
are not additionally run as global snippets on Play. Save asset edits before Play.

Logging: `debug.log(...)`, `debug.warning(...)`, `debug.error(...)`, or `print(...)`.
`debug.error` logs without throwing. This restricted `debug` table is not Lua's
introspection library. The Console offers **Copy all** and right-click **Copy message**.
Lua has bounded memory/instructions and no filesystem/process/module access.
